Anagrafica PCTO Software Test Plan



# INTRODUCTION

This exercise essentially discovers faults and failures in the software. Faults lead to failures and testing is necessary to eliminate these errors in the software development process. The following document outlines the testing procedures for the Golden Boys Team Anagrafica PCTO software project.

## Test Specifications

This section highlights the different levels of tests performed during the software development process. Includes integration tests performed by the team tester to verify that the system meets the requirements and functions as expected. The complete test procedures are described in the test specification document.

## Test Reports

Test reportsoffer feedback about the testing exercise and are informational to project stakeholders. The reports in this testing exercise track incidents, defects, and changeswhile testing the system.

Incident reports track descriptions of incidents, the originator, severity and priority, steps required to produce the defect, the responder, current status, cause, resolution and date the incident was addressed. The document will also track in what phase of the development process the incident was created or detected.

Defect reportsreference the unique identifier in the incident report, list affected items, the owner, required changes, status, phases where the defect was introduced and detected,and general comments or notes.

Change reportssummarize the total number of unit tests, integration tests, and system tests, the items and features tested, comprehensiveness of the assessment, the total number of incidents and defects, and unresolved incidents.

## Project Plan

The project plan reconciles the time schedule and release of candidates with the unit, integration, and system testing.

## Quality Assurance Plan
