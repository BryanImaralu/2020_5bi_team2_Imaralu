## Success Criteria for Golden PCTO Project

The Golden PCTO project will be considered a success if . . .

**A fully functional test system is delivered on or before June 17th.****

The system shall be delivered in a state that is ready to be used in its intended production environment for its intended purpose. The users shall be given the training they need in order to begin using the system. We will consider both of these goals met if the users who plan to use the system during its test period fill out the attached Acceptance Test User Survey and:

+ No one circles &quot;No&quot; on the first two questions

+ If anyone circles &quot;Yes, with reservations&quot; on the first two questions, these reservations shall be resolved prior to May 4th to the satisfaction of the users with the reservations

**Concerns raised during the test period are addressed according to the problem resolution plan contained in the Software Project Management Plan.**

All critical defects found before March 25th will be fixed. A critical defect is one for which there is no convenient workaround. Beyond fixing defects, requested changes will be handled on a sliding scale. Changes taking 30 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 3 weeks before the scheduled end of the project. Changes taking 20 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 2 weeks before the scheduled end of the project. Changes taking 10 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 1 week before the scheduled end of the project.

Users shall be notified of their rights and responsibilities under this policy prior to the start of acceptance test.

**G. Marconi students can easily log into the system.**

This specifically means that a G. Marconi student will be able to select the login option, type their Spaggiari&#39;s credentials and log into the system.

**Golden PCTO administrators can create and edit companies&#39; information.**

This includes admin accounts. All data should be editable from the web application interface.

**The Golden PCTO database is updated.**

Data from PAL&#39;s existing database is uploaded to the new system. Data from all fields in the existing database shall be migrated to corresponding fields in the new database.

**Golden PCTO supervisors can print all reports outlined in spreadsheet sample reports provided during 2/12 requirements meeting.**

These reports shall be in the form of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheets with the data properly displayed. The data on the report should accurately reflect that which is in the database.

**Raw data on companies and students&#39; activities is available for download.**

Officers shall be able to download raw data on youth and their activities in order to produce ad hoc reports.

**The System is properly documented.**

First, a user guide shall be produced and included with the system. This user guide shall be easy to understand for non-technical users familiar with basic Internet and spreadsheet concepts. This manual shall explain only how to use all features of the system.

Second, a system manual shall be produced. This system manual shall consist of the architecture document, as well as any additional material required to provide a technician with all necessary information needed to maintain and update the system. A single read through of this document and no more than 2 hours looking at the code should provide an appropriately skilled technician with all the information necessary to understand the system and make simple changes such as add a field to a generated report.

**Known defects are entered into the Bugzilla defect tracking system.**

After April 25th defects that are found but not fixed immediately (less than 24 hours) will be entered into the Bugzilla defect tracking system. At the end of the project there shall be no unresolved defects with severity blocker or critical.
