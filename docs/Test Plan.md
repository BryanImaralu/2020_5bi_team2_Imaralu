# IDENTIFIER

Anagrafica PCTO Software Test Plan



# INTRODUCTION

This exercise essentially discovers faults and failures in the software. Faults lead to failures and testing is necessary to eliminate these errors in the software development process. The following document outlines the testing procedures for the Golden Boys Team Anagrafica PCTO software project.

## Test Specifications

This section highlights the different levels of tests performed during the software development process. Includes integration tests performed by the team tester to verify that the system meets the requirements and functions as expected. The complete test procedures are described in the test specification document.

## Test Reports

Test reportsoffer feedback about the testing exercise and are informational to project stakeholders. The reports in this testing exercise track incidents, defects, and changeswhile testing the system.

Incident reports track descriptions of incidents, the originator, severity and priority, steps required to produce the defect, the responder, current status, cause, resolution and date the incident was addressed. The document will also track in what phase of the development process the incident was created or detected.

Defect reportsreference the unique identifier in the incident report, list affected items, the owner, required changes, status, phases where the defect was introduced and detected,and general comments or notes.

Change reportssummarize the total number of unit tests, integration tests, and system tests, the items and features tested, comprehensiveness of the assessment, the total number of incidents and defects, and unresolved incidents.

## Project Plan

The project plan reconciles the time schedule and release of candidates with the unit, integration, and system testing.

## Quality Assurance Plan

Yet to be defined.







# ITEMS AND FEATURES TESTED

## User Website

User website testing takes place in the integration and system testing phases. During integration, the tester will test functions of the system and how the system behaves with additional features. During system testing, the team will test the system as a whole and cross-check the results with the requirements.

Test items:

- Verify user as student
- Verify user as tutor
- User asks a question
- User reads answers to previous questions

## Bulletin Board

Research tests take place in integration and system tests. The tester will test the project functions during integration, repeat them after adding the functionality to make sure they are working properly.

System tests will test all aspects of the system and cross-check them with the requirements document to ensure that the customer&#39;s requirements have been met.

Test items:

- Provider chooses user question
- Tutors and students read and discuss question
- Provider rejects student answer
- Provider accepts student answer
- Provider adds a student user







# APPROACH

## Strategy

The test approach includes the role play of team members by acting as website users. The activities performed will be similar to the activities carried out by the website users. These include searching for companies through characteristics belonging to them, the complete view data, and other user activities. Team members will also create unexpected scenarios to test how the system will respond to those scenarios.

System tests will be performed by the team to measure how the system meets the requirements. Team members will be asked to research companies to verify system functionality and to determine if it lives up to customer expectations.

## Techniques/Tools

Developers will run unit tests to verify code functionality and software execution and test on chrome. They will also perform other tests.

Testers will develop test cases and perform tests. Testers and team members will also review the code to find bugs and errors that developers may not detect.

## Test Goals

The objectives of this test exercise include researching various user situations and testing against these situations in order to discover any errors that could cause failure. The ultimate goal is to ensure that the team provides an error-free functioning system.





# TEST DELIVERABLES

- A test plan that delineates the testing phase of the development process
- A test specification document detailing steps in the testing procedures
- Test reports documenting incidents, defects and changes



# TESTING TASKS

Testing tasks for integration and system testing are outlined in the test specification document.




# SCHEDULE

Testing will occur at each phase of the development process. Test cases are outlined in the test specification document for the iterations.
