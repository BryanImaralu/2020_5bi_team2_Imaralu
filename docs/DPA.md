Golden Boys Group will engage Sub-processors pursuant to the requirements set forth in Section 4 “Sub-
 processors” below.

Data for the following purposes: (i) Processing in accordance with the Agreement and applicable
Order Form(s); (ii) Processing initiated by Authorized Users in their use of the Services; and (iii)
Processing to comply with other reasonable instructions provided by Customer (e.g., via email or

 Purpose.

Golden Boys receives any requests from a Data Subject to exercise the following Data Subject rights: access,
rectification, restriction of Processing, erasure (“right to be forgotten”), data portability, objection to

Subject Request ”). Taking into account the nature of the Processing, Golden Boys shall assist Customer by
appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of
Customer’s obligation to respond to a Data Subject Request under applicable Data Protection Laws.
In addition, to the extent Customer, in its use of the Services, does not have the ability to address a
Data Subject Request, Golden Boys shall, upon Customer’s request, provide commercially reasonable efforts
to assist Customer in responding to such Data Subject Request, to the extent Golden Boys is legally
permitted to do so and the response to such Data Subject Request is required under applicable Data
Protection Laws. To the extent legally permitted, Customer shall be responsible for any costs arising
from Golden Boys’s provision of such assistance, including any fees associated with provision of additional
 functionality.

# 4. SUB-PROCESSORS

### 4.1 Appointment of Sub-processors. Customer acknowledges and agrees that (a) Golden Boys’s Affiliates may

be retained as Sub-processors; and (b) Golden Boys and Golden Boys’s Affiliates respectively may engage third-
party Sub-processors in connection with the provision of the Services. As a condition to permitting a
third-party Sub-processor to Process Personal Data, Golden Boys or a Golden Boys Affiliate will enter into a written
agreement with each Sub-processor containing data protection obligations that provide at least the
same level of protection for Personal Data as those in this DPA, to the extent applicable to the nature
of the Services provided by such Sub-processor. Customer acknowledges that Golden Boys Technologies,
Inc. is located in the United States and is involved in providing the Services to Customer either
directly or through the provision of support to Golden Boys Technologies Limited. In either case, Customer
agrees to enter into the Standard Contractual Clauses set out in Exhibit C and acknowledges that
 sub processors may be appointed by GoldenBoys in accordance with Clause 11 of Exhibit C.

### 4.2 List of Current Sub-processors and Notification of New Sub-processors. A current list of Sub-

processors for the Services, including the identities of those Sub-processors and their country of
location.
Customer may receive notifications of new Sub-processors by e-mailing dpa@Golden Boys-corp.com with
the subject “Subscribe”, and if a Customer contact subscribes, Golden Boys shall provide the subscriber with
notification of new Sub-processor(s) before authorizing such new Sub-processor(s) to Process
 Personal Data in connection with the provision of the applicable Services.

### 4.3 Objection Right for New Sub-processors. Customer may reasonably object to Golden Boys’s use of a new

 Sub-processor (e.g., if making Personal Data available to the Sub-processor may violate applicable Data
 Protection Law or weaken the protections for such Personal Data) by notifying Golden Boys promptly in writing
within ten (10) business days after receipt of Golden Boys’s notice in accordance with the mechanism set
out in Section 4.2. Such notice shall explain the reasonable grounds for the objection. In the event
Customer objects to a new Sub-processor, as permitted in the preceding sentence, Golden Boys will use
commercially reasonable efforts to make available to Customer a change in the Services or
recommend a commercially reasonable change to Customer’s configuration or use of the Services to
avoid Processing of Personal Data by the objected-to new Sub-processor without unreasonably
burdening Customer. If Golden Boys is unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of
time, which shall not exceed thirty (30) days, either party may terminate without penalty the
applicable Order Form(s) with respect only to those Services which cannot be provided by Golden Boys
without the use of the objected-to new Sub-processor by providing written notice to Golden Boys. Golden Boys will
refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of such Order Form(s)
following the effective date of termination with respect to such terminated Services, without
 imposing a penalty for such termination on Customer.

### 4.4 Liability. Golden Boys shall be liable for the acts and omissions of its Sub-processors to the same extent

Golden Boys would be liable if performing the Services of each Sub-processor directly under the terms of
 this DPA.

# 5. SECURITY

### 5.1 Controls for the Protection of Customer Data. Golden Boys shall maintain appropriate technical and

organizational measures for protection of the security (including protection against unauthorized or
unlawful Processing and against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration or damage,
unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Customer Data), confidentiality and integrity of Customer
Data, as set forth in the Security Practices Datasheet. Golden Boys regularly monitors compliance with these
measures. Golden Boys will not materially decrease the overall security of the Services during a subscription
 term.

### 5.2 Third-Party Certifications and Audits. Golden Boys has obtained the third-party certifications and audits

set forth in the Security Practices Datasheet. Upon Customer’s request, and subject to the
confidentiality obligations set forth in the Agreement, Golden Boys shall make available to Customer (or
Customer’s independent, third-party auditor) information regarding the Golden Boys Group’s compliance
with the obligations set forth in this DPA in the form of the third-party certifications and audits set
forth in the Security Practices Datasheet. Customer may contact Golden Boys in accordance with the
“Notices” Section of the Agreement to request an on-site audit of Golden Boys’s procedures relevant to the
protection of Personal Data, but only to the extent required under applicable Data Protection Law.
Customer shall reimburse Golden Boys for any time expended for any such on-site audit at the Golden Boys Group’s
then-current rates, which shall be made available to Customer upon request. Before the
commencement of any such on-site audit, Customer and Golden Boys shall mutually agree upon the scope,
timing, and duration of the audit, in addition to the reimbursement rate for which Customer shall be
responsible. All reimbursement rates shall be reasonable, taking into account the resources
expended by Golden Boys. Customer shall promptly notify Golden Boys with information regarding any non-
compliance discovered during the course of an audit, and Golden Boys shall use commercially reasonable
 efforts to address any confirmed non-compliance.

# 6. CUSTOMER DATA INCIDENT MANAGEMENT AND NOTIFICATION

Golden Boys maintains security incident management policies and procedures specified in the Security
Practices Datasheet. Golden Boys shall notify Customer of any breach relating to Personal Data (within the
meaning of applicable Data Protection Law) of which Golden Boys becomes aware and which may require a
notification to be made to a Supervisory Authority or Data Subject under applicable Data Protection
Law or which Golden Boys is required to notify to Customer under applicable Data Protection Law (a
“ Customer Data Incident ”). Golden Boys shall provide commercially reasonable cooperation and
assistance in identifying the cause of such Customer Data Incident and take commercially reasonable
steps to remediate the cause to the extent the remediation is within Golden Boys’s control. The obligations
herein shall not apply to incidents that are caused by Customer, Authorized Users and/or any Non-
 Golden Boys Products.

# 7. RETURN AND DELETION OF CUSTOMER DATA

Upon termination of the Services for which Golden Boys is Processing Personal Data, Golden Boys shall, upon Customer’s
request, and subject to the limitations described in the Agreement and the Security Practices Datasheet,
return all Customer Data and copies of such data to Customer or securely destroy them and demonstrate
to the satisfaction of Customer that it has taken such measures, unless applicable law prevents it from
returning or destroying all or part of Customer Data. For clarification, depending on the Service plan
purchased by Customer, access to export functionality may incur additional charge(s) and/or require
purchase of a Service upgrade. Golden Boys agrees to preserve the confidentiality of any retained Customer Data
and will only actively Process such Customer Data after such date in order to comply with the laws it is
 subject to.

# 8. CONTROLLER AFFILIATES

### 8.1 Contractual Relationship. The parties acknowledge and agree that, by executing the DPA in

accordance with “HOW TO EXECUTE THIS DPA”, Customer enters into the DPA on behalf of itself
and, as applicable, in the name and on behalf of its Controller Affiliates, thereby establishing a
separate DPA between Golden Boys and each such Controller Affiliate subject to the provisions of the
Agreement and this Section 8 and Section 9. Each Controller Affiliate agrees to be bound by the
obligations under this DPA and, to the extent applicable, the Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
a Controller Affiliate is not and does not become a party to the Agreement, and is only a party to the
DPA. All access to and use of the Services by Controller Affiliates must comply with the terms and
conditions of the Agreement and any violation of the terms and conditions of the Agreement by a
 Controller Affiliate shall be deemed a violation by Customer.

### 8.2 Communication. The Customer that is the contracting party to the Agreement shall remain

responsible for coordinating all communication with Golden Boys under this DPA and be entitled to make
 and receive any communication in relation to this DPA on behalf of its Controller Affiliates.

### 8.3 Rights of Controller Affiliates. If a Controller Affiliate becomes a party to the DPA with Golden Boys,

 it shall, to the extent required under applicable Data Protection Laws, also be entitled to exercise the
 rights and seek remedies under this DPA, subject to the following:

### 8.3.1 Except where applicable Data Protection Laws require the Controller Affiliate to exercise a

right or seek any remedy under this DPA against Golden Boys directly by itself, the parties agree
that (i) solely the Customer that is the contracting party to the Agreement shall exercise any
such right or seek any such remedy on behalf of the Controller Affiliate, and (ii) the
Customer that is the contracting party to the Agreement shall exercise any such rights under
this DPA not separately for each Controller Affiliate individually but in a combined manner
 for all of its Controller Affiliates together (as set forth, for example, in Section 8.3.2, below).

### 8.3.2 The parties agree that the Customer that is the contracting party to the Agreement shall, if

 carrying out an on-site audit of the Golden Boys procedures relevant to the protection of Personal
Data, take all reasonable measures to limit any impact on Golden Boys by combining, to the extent
reasonable possible, several audit requests carried out on behalf of different Controller

 Affiliates in one single audit.

# 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

Each party’s and all of its Affiliates’ liability, taken together in the aggregate, arising out of or related
to this DPA, and all DPAs between Controller Affiliates and Golden Boys, whether in contract, tort or under
any other theory of liability, is subject to the ‘Limitation of Liability’ section of the Agreement, and
any reference in such section to the liability of a party means the aggregate liability of that party and
 all of its Affiliates under the Agreement and all DPAs together.

For the avoidance of doubt, Golden Boys’s and its Affiliates’ total liability for all claims from the Customer
and all of its Controller Affiliates arising out of or related to the Agreement and each DPA shall apply
in the aggregate for all claims under both the Agreement and all DPAs established under the
Agreement, including by Customer and all Controller Affiliates, and, in particular, shall not be
understood to apply individually and severally to Customer and/or to any Controller Affiliate that is
 a contractual party to any such DPA.

# 10. EUROPEAN SPECIFIC PROVISIONS

### 10.1 GDPR. With effect from 25 May 2018, Golden Boys will Process Personal Data in accordance with the GDPR

 Requirements directly applicable to Golden Boys’s provisioning of the Services.

### 10.1.1 Data Protection Impact Assessment. Upon Customer’s request, Golden Boys shall provide

Customer with reasonable cooperation and assistance needed to fulfil Customer’s obligation
under the GDPR to carry out a data protection impact assessment related to Customer’s use
of the Services, to the extent Customer does not otherwise have access to the relevant
information, and to the extent such information is available to Golden Boys. Golden Boys shall provide
reasonable assistance to Customer in the cooperation or prior consultation with the
 Supervisory Authority, to the extent required under the GDPR.

### 10.2 Transfer Mechanisms. As of the effective date of this DPA, Golden Boys self-certifies to and complies with

the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks, as administered by the US Department of
Commerce. For transfers of Personal Data under this DPA from the European Union, the European
Economic Area and/or their member states and Switzerland to countries which do not ensure an
adequate level of data protection within the meaning of applicable Data Protection Laws of the
foregoing territories, to the extent such transfers are subject to such applicable Data Protection

 Laws:

1.  Golden Boys’s EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework self-certifications apply; and

2.  The Standard Contractual Clauses set forth in Exhibit C to this DPA apply, subject to
    Exhibit A.

above have been fully completed. If Customer has previously executed a data processing addendum
 with Golden Boys, this DPA supersedes and replaces such prior Data Processing Addendum.

Data Exporter, arising out of a breach by the Data Importer or his subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to
in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the Data Exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has

1.  The Data Importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the Data
Exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the Data Exporter. Where the Data Importer
subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the Data Exporter, it shall do so only by way of a
written agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on
the Data Importer under the Clauses. Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such
written agreement the Data Importer shall remain fully liable to the Data Exporter for the performance of the
 subprocessor's obligations under such agreement.

2.  The prior written contract between the Data Importer and the subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the Data Exporter or the Data Importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the Data Exporter or Data Importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.

3.  The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the Data Exporter is established.

4.  The Data Exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the Data Importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the Data Exporter's data protection supervisory authority.

# Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services

1.  The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the Data Importer and
the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the Data Exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies
thereof to the Data Exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the Data Exporter that it has done so,
unless legislation imposed upon the Data Importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal
data transferred. In that case, the Data Importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data
 transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.

2.  The Data Importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the Data Exporter and/or of the
supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.
